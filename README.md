<p>Hurón Operating System or “huronOS” is an Ubuntu Budgie fork that contains a set of scripts, configurations, editors, compilers, interpreters and IDES prepared for competitive programming contests such as ICPC, IOI, CodeJam, HackerCup or even training platform contests like Codeforces, HackerRank or TopCoder, etc …</p>
<p>Currently 3 ways of distributing the operating system are planned:</p>
<dl>
<dt>contestImage</dt>
<dd>It is an ISO image of the operating system installed on a USB with the “live to ram” function that allows the system to work at high speed. This image has preconfigured persistence partitions to avoid data loss. It is an image ready to be burned on a USB stick and used in a contest.</dd>
<dt>installationImage</dt>
<dd>It is an ISO image that contains an assisted guide to installing the operating system on a computer, just like the installers of other operating systems such as Ubuntu, Debian, Windows or even macOS. This image is prepared for a clean, non-portable installation.</dd>
<dt>sourceCode</dt>
<dd>A free repository for downloading, compiling and modifying the operating system.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Only 1 of these 3 distributions are currently ready to use.</p>
