# Configuration file for alsa-base

# List, separated by spaces, the names of modules that should be
# unloaded, if present, before the machine is suspended. Use the
# special name "all" if you would like all ALSA sound modules to be
# removed. The modules that are removed will be loaded again after
# resume.  Currently this only has an effect if you are using apmd.
# Examples:
#     Value         Action at suspend time
#     ""            Do nothing
#     "snd-cs46xx"  Stop sound processes and remove the snd-cs46xx module
#     "all"         Stop sound processes and remove all ALSA modules
