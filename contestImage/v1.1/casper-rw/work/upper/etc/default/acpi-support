#
# Configuration file for the acpi-support package
#
#
# The acpi-support package is intended as "glue" to make special functions of
# laptops work. Specifically, it translates special function keys for some
# laptop models into actions or generic function key presses.
#


#
# Suspend/hibernate method
# ------------------------
#
# When gnome-power-manager or klaptopdaemon are running, acpi-support will
# translate the suspend and hibernate keys of laptops into special "suspend"
# and "hibernate" keys that these daemons handle.
#
# Only in situations where there is no gnome-power-manager or klaptopdaemon
# running, acpi-support needs to perform suspend/hibernate in some other way.
# There are several options for this. The options are:
#
# dbus-pm:
#    Perform suspend and hibernate actions via a DBUS request to the power
#    management daemon. This works for power management daemons that we don't
#    know of. (For gnome-power-manager and klaptopdaemon this will do nothing,
#    since those will be detected when they are running, and triggered using
#    a virtual keypress.)
#
# dbus-hal:
#    Perform suspend and hibernate actions via a DBUS request directly to HAL,
#    bypassing any running power management daemons.
#
# pm-utils:
#    Use pm-suspend and pm-hibernate to suspend and hibernate. (The dbus method
#    normally results in this as well, but calls through dbus. Use this option
#    only if you don't have dbus installed.)
#
# hibernate:
#    Use the hibernate package to suspend and hibernate.
#
# acpi-support:
#    Use the legacy built-in suspend/hibernate support. (DEPRECATED)
# 
# none:
#    Do not attempt to suspend/hibernate. Set SUSPEND_METHODS="none" to
#    disable suspend/hibernate handling in acpi-support.
#
# If you specify dbus or pm-utils, the result will normally be the same as when
# you suspend from your desktop environment. If you specify "hibernate" or
# "acpi-support", be aware that this probably does not match what your desktop
# environment would do (unless you have managed to configure something so that
# the DBUS power management interfaces call the hibernate package).
#
#
# Please specify a space separated list of options. The recommended value is
# "dbus pm-utils"
#
SUSPEND_METHODS="dbus-pm dbus-hal pm-utils"

# LEGACY BUILT IN SUSPEND SUPPORT (DEPRECATED)

# These options only work for the "acpi-support" suspend method. This is NOT
# recommended, but is retained for backward compatibility reasons.
